# Enhanced Fruchterman-Reingold: Scalable Visualization and Optimization Techniques for Complex Networks
This repository contains the layout configuration files to the manuscript submitted to *The Visual Computer*.

## Repository Contents

### 1. Original Data (`Raw Data.gexf`)
This project utilizes the standard *Les Misérables* co-appearance network dataset (74 nodes, 248 edges). It maps the interactions between characters in Victor Hugo's novel.

### 2. Gephi Project Files (`.gephi`)
These files contain the force-directed graph layouts discussed in Section 3.0 of the paper. They demonstrate the structural clarity of the network using the following parameters:
* Area Sizes: 100, 1000, 10000
* Gravity Sizes: 1.0, 5.0, 10.0
